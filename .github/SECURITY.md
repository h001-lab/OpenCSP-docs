## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of OpenCSP seriously. Instead of opening a public issue, please use GitHub's native security reporting feature to report vulnerabilities privately.

### How to report:
1. Navigate to the **Security** tab of this repository.
2. Click on **Vulnerability reporting** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Report a vulnerability** to submit your findings privately.

We will acknowledge your report and coordinate a fix as soon as possible. Thank you for helping keep OpenCSP secure.
